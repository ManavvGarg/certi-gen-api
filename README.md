## Certi-Gen: Professional Certificate Generation Solution

**Introducing Certi-Gen 💡**

Certi-Gen is a cutting-edge platform designed to effortlessly generate mass certificates for any event. Simplifying the process, users can upload their template certificate in popular image formats such as .png, .jpg, or .jpeg, along with an excel sheet in .xls or .xlsx format. Additionally, users have the option to choose the font size and even upload a custom font to further customize their certificates.

## Key Features:

- Swift Generation: With a simple click of the "Generate Certificates" button, Certi-Gen processes the data efficiently. The generation time depends on the size of the excel sheet, ensuring rapid results regardless of the dataset's scale.

- Professional "pdf" Format: All certificates are generated in a professional-grade "pdf" format, ensuring a polished and standardized appearance.

- Zip File Convenience: Upon completion, Certi-Gen consolidates all generated certificates into a convenient zip file. Users can effortlessly download and unzip the file, streamlining the distribution process.

## Note:

1. Excel Sheet Requirements: The excel sheet should contain only one column (feature) named "Name," under which all the names of the participants should be listed.

2. Font Customization: In the absence of a custom font upload, all names will be written in the "Montserrat - ALL BLACK" font, provided it is a True Type Font (.ttf).

3. Certificate Design Consideration: To ensure optimal results, design your template certificate with the name placement in the middle. Certi-Gen utilizes the uploaded template's Width and Height to calculate the origin point and position the names accordingly. It also readjusts font size dynamically to accommodate longer names.
